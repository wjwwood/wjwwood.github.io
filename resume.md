For more projects see my [Project](/projects.html) page.

### Technical Skills

I have an extensive code portfolio at Github: https://github.com/wjwwood

These are the languages in which I have work a non-trivial amount (listed in order of proficiency):

- Python
- C++
- C
- Javascript/Coffeescript
- Java

I have experience with these major Operating Systems:

- Windows XP, 7, 8.1
 - I administrated Windows machines across the company of ~1500 employees
- Linux
 - I have used Linux since starting on Gentoo in 2007, and I would consider myself an expert
- OS X
 - I do all my personal and professional development on my MacBook using OS X

For development, I am grew up working in Textmate on OS X, and these days I am using Sublime Text, but I am looking forward to [atom.io](https://atom.io/). So I normally work with a solid text editor and command line tools in a terminal. I use IDE's only when appropriate for the environment like for iOS or Android development.
