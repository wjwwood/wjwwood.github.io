For more projects see my [Project](/projects.html) page.

### Technical Skills

I have an extensive code portfolio on Github: [https://github.com/wjwwood](https://github.com/wjwwood)

These are the languages in which I have worked a non-trivial amount:

- Python
- C++
- C
- Javascript/Coffeescript
- Java

I have experience with these major Operating Systems:

- Windows XP, 7, 8.1, 10
  - I administrated Windows machines across a company of ~1500 employees
  - I have experience developing C++ code for Windows as part of the ROS 2.0 work
- Linux
  - I have used Linux since I started using Gentoo in 2007, and I would consider myself an expert
  - I have extensive C++ and Python experience on Linux as part of ROS and ROS 2.0 work
- OS X
  - I do all my personal and professional development on a MacBook Pro using macOS

For development, I started out working in Textmate on OS X, and these days I am using Sublime Text, but I am looking forward to [atom.io](https://atom.io/).
I normally work only with a solid text editor and command-line tools in a terminal.
I use IDE's only when appropriate for the environment like for iOS or Android development.
